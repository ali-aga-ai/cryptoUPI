having additional constraints like no duplicate phone num(done but merchant side is left(should be done if database/blockchain has been setup))

VMID created using speck HOWEVER the vmid functionality is not complete yet (done as far as encryption part is concerned qr is also generated in between communication of merchant and machine)

change main.js, create an easier way to interface with user rather than a million different if else stmts

also add functionality of connecting user and merchant with upi machine. currently as soon as user or merchant

is selected the main.js file by defaults directs/connects them to the bank server and not the upi machine server.(connection between merchant and machine done if he is a new user)

figure out proper sending of qr code to user

WORKFLOW:
BANK SERVER STARTS
MACHINE SERVER STARTS AND CONNECTS TO BANK
MERCHANT SERVER STARTS AND CONNECTS TO BANK AND MACHINE (CONNECCTING TO MACHHINE INVOLVES QR CODE SETUP)
USER SERVER STARTS AND CONNECTS TO BANK

USER WANTS TO DO A TXN, HE INPUTS MERCHANT ID / NAME, CORRESPONDING MERCHANT QR CODE IS FETCHED
THE FETCHED QR CODE IS SCANNED FOR VMID ETC. 
TXN DETAILS ARE FILLED
TXN DATA ENCODED

TXN SENT TO MACHINE FOR VALIDATION
MACHINE ASKS BANK, BANK RESPONDS WITH APPROVAL STATUS
TXN EXECUTED
