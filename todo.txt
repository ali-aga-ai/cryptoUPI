having additional constraints like no duplicate phone num(done but merchant side is left(should be done if database/blockchain has been setup))
VMID created using speck HOWEVER the vmid functionality is not complete yet (done as far as encryption part is concerned qr is also generated in between communication of merchant and machine)
change main.js, create an easier way to interface with user rather than a million different if else stmts
also add functionality of connecting user and merchant with upi machine. currently as soon as user or merchant
is selected the main.js file by defaults directs/connects them to the bank server and not the upi machine server.(connection between merchant and machine done if he is a new user)
